# Randomize Interloper Rare Spawns

This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Studio, Inc.

On vanilla interloper, finding one rare item allows the player to know the locations of every other rare item in the game world. This mod eliminates that certainty.

* There are numerous locations that the items can spawn at across the game world.
* All spawn points have been hand-placed and are each specific to one particular item.
* Spawns are purely random and not dependent on any other the spawn of any other items.
* Like the vanilla game mode, hammers cannot be found in regions with a forge.
* Other than the above limit on hammer spawns, rare items can be found in any region and are almost evenly distributed.
* There is one guaranteed spawn in the world for each rare item.
* Note: **DO NOT** use with existing saves. It will probably delete your rare items.

## Guaranteed Spawns
